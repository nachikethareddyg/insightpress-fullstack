# InsightPress: Full-Stack Publishing Platform

## Overview
InsightPress is a full-stack project that simulates a modern publishing workflow:
users can create, edit, and publish posts, and the platform supports clean data
models for analytics and future AI features like summarization and auto-tagging.

---

## What This Project Does
- User authentication (login/signup)
- Create / edit / delete posts (CRUD)
- Draft vs published posts
- Basic search and filtering (by title/tags)
- Clean API structure (ready for deployment)

---

## Tech Stack (suggested)
Frontend: React / Next.js  
Backend: FastAPI or Node.js (Express)  
Database: PostgreSQL (or SQLite for local demo)

---

## Planned Structure
- `apps/web/` – frontend
- `apps/api/` – backend
- `docs/` – architecture + API docs
- `scripts/` – setup helpers

---

## Future Enhancements
- Role-based access (author/editor/admin)
- Comments + moderation
- Analytics dashboard
- AI: auto-summary, auto-tags, SEO suggestions
